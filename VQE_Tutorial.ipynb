    "So you want to find the lowest eigenvalue/eigenvector of a very large matrix. Maybe that matrix represents the energy operator of some quantum system whose ground state you're interested in. Maybe you have other motives. Either way, since the matrix is very large, it's going to be inconvenient to directly solve for its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. On the other hand, if we actually had a quantum system, we could evaluate expectation values like $\\langle \\psi \\mid H \\mid \\psi \\rangle$. Could we use that to help us? \n",

Over the course of the experiments, we accumulate counts, the number $N_{\\uparrow}$ and the number $N_{\\downarrow}$, which we divide by the total number $N$ of experiments, to obtain the probabilities $p_{\\uparrow} = \\frac{N_{\\uparrow}}{N}, p_{\\downarrow} = \\frac{N_{\\downarrow}}{N}$. We associate $\\uparrow$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\uparrow} = 1$ and $\\downarrow$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\downarrow} = -1$, and sum them, weighted by their probabilities. This is the expectation value $\\langle \\psi \\mid Z \\mid \\psi \\rangle = (1)p_{\\uparrow} + (-1)p_{\\uparrow}$.

If ${\\alpha_{\\uparrow}} = 0$, then we have an extra point, not on the plane, which corresponds to the pole of projection on the sphere.

We can get the same effect as a $Y$ measurement by first doing a rotation of $90^{\\circ}$ aka $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ around the $X$ axis, which rotates $Y^{+}$ into $Z^{+}$ (and $Y^{-}$ into $Z^{-}$). So we can turn a $Z$ measurement into a $Y$ measurement by first applying $R_{x}(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{4}iX}$ to our qubit $\\mid \\psi \\rangle$, and then measuring.\n",

    "So in the end, the answer is: when $\\theta = \\pi$, the ansatz is $-\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which corresponds (up to phase) to the lowest eigenstate of $H$ with eigenvalue $-1$. We could imagine more sophisticated schemes, involving more elaborate ansatze, using fancier algorithms to search through the parameters, from gradient descent onward, generating thousands upon thousands of circuits that when implemented thousands upon thousands of times allow one to estimate the lowest eigenvalue/eigenvector of a matrix faster than a classical computer.\n",
